First and foremost, your uniform, we fight under the Amish Flag in
full garb. This includes a short sleeve white button down shirt, with
black suspenders, black pants, dress pants if you have an old pair, I
find these or khakis to be the most comfortable. Black jeans, though
while accepted, are not recommended due to discomfort. As long as the
shoes are black, any will do as long as they are comfortable.
Remember, while we want to look good, you also want to be practical
about what you wear, as we will be running, ducking, shooting, diving,
ect.<br><br>

       <div class="content">
You guys are gonna get thirsty, its inevitable, the game lasts 11 hours,
we fight for maybe 5 or 6. Smoke and dirt and paint will get in your
mouth, you'll want to clean off your visor so you can see, you'll want to
cool off, there is a million reasons to bring water. Last year we didn't
nearly have enough and we were starved for it, so this year <b> it is
mandatory</b> everyone bring a case of water for their own use.<br><br>

       <div class="content">
Snacks, while not mandatory, are highly suggested, in additon to being
thirsty, you are going to get hungry as well. When were at the hotel, we
will order pizza or something, however in the midst of battle, either you
go back out to the stands and pay for a $30 hot dog, or you bring some pop
tarts, we set up a perimeter, and take 5 minutes to eat.<br><br>

       <label for="tab-4">Money</label>

       <div class="content">
This should be a given, while everyone going I am sure will cover one
another if need be, don't be dumb, bring money. For one, you will want
atleast one smoke grenade for the beach landing, whether for clearing out
a bunker, or giving you cover when you hope the wall, it is almost
essential, they are pretty cheap and a lot of vendors have them. The
second reason is that CO2 fills are not free, you need to get a $10
wristband that covers fills for the weekend, and while we all wont have to
get this band, if you are using CO2 you will need to pitch in to get one,
unless you accomplish using only 1 tank fill the entire weekend. Lastly,
if something on your gun breaks, the vendors sell spare parts, or offer
repairs, so just for emergency sake.<br><br>

       <label for="tab-5">Backpack</label>

       <div class="content">
<b>Bringing a small backpack is also mandatory this year.</b>You will have
crap to carry, and if you don't want to walk a couple miles back to the
cars for refills on ammo or water, then you want a backpack, also
considering we move as as squad, its a right pain to have to wait for
people to refill if they only have 1 thing of water, or 1 extra bag of
ammo, so be courteous, bring a bag big enough to hold your junk, while not
impeding your ability to move.<br><br>

While not required it is highly suggested that if you don't have a baby
face, that you let your beard grow out, and do the real Amish back home
proud.
